Final Project Outline


8 possible responses:
It is certain
It is decidedly so
My sources say no
Outlook not so good
You may rely on it
Ask me again later
Concentrate and ask again
Outlook good

Sample interaction:
Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question.
Will I win the lottery?
Concentrate and ask again.

First the code requests you to ask a question.
You then type in the question and it generates a predetermined answer based up a randomly generated number that is returned. 
The answer is then communicated to the user.
